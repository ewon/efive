# First parameter is event: system, network, red
# Second parameter is value: up, down
#
# Do something like:
#   if [ ${1} == "red" -a ${2} == "up" ]; then
#       echo "RED up"
#   fi
#
# this replaces rc.local:
#   if [ ${1} == "system" -a ${2} == "up" ]; then
#       echo "up and running"
#   fi
