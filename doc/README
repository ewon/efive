General
-------
This is the first version of IPCop.  It was originally based on Smoothwall, 
but the distribution is actually built from source.

License
-------
All of the code included in this release has been distributed under the GPL. 
You should find a copy of the GPL included.  

Building
------------
First, do    :	chmod 755 make.sh
Build using  :	./make.sh build
Cleanup using:	./make.sh clean

The building will also rebuild the Linux kernel.  With the ipsec patches
applied, I have only managed to build the kernel using kgcc.  gcc 2.9.6 and
gcc 3.0.1 failed to build the kernel!!!

If you have any questions, remarks or patches, please send me an e-mail.
