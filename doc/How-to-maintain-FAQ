What you could do
Post a question to the FAQ ( anybody logged-in could)
	FAQ is not the way to ask for help, but to provide help with solutions
	to know problems. You would have an anwser faster going to ipcop-user
	list or any forum related to IPCop (see Support on the menu).
	Users could post any questions but a particular subject may not need an
	entry to the FAQ. Unfortunaly many of the entries posted there does not
	qualify as appropriate questions and they have to be deleted.

Anwser to the FAQ (need Power users rights)
	You show questions waiting for answer at the left bottom of the screen
	Waiting content : Frequently asked questions
	You could post you own questions to enlight the FAQ

	We should improve the 'Ask a question' screen to state that standard question
	should be asked on ipcop-user or on the various available forums.

Edit the FAQ (need Admin rights)
	Go to the Administration menu in 3-rd-party tab and click on FAQ module
	Then with each 'content' link, you could edit each menu entry of the FAQ

You should ask preferably on ipcop-devel the right to work on the FAQ or other documents.
Better ask on ipcop-user if you are not registered on ipcop-devel.
