Compile on sparc arch and test ipcop for sparc (IPCop only support sparc64)

Short installation notes for those like me (Gilles) unfamiliar with sparc

Goal : install debian etch with sparc netboot (work for me on Ultra5)

On the sparc machine
- start the machine
- stop the machine to boot with keyboard function stop + A
- note ethernet MAC address
- prompt should be ok.
  If silo has already started (prompt is silo), type halt, prompt should go back to ok

I find more convenient to have a fixed name for the file to load and switch the
real file to be loaded with a symlink on the tftp server.
So the file name that the dhcp server send is set to 'sparc'

On the dhcp server (could be an IPCop)
- write a fixed lease on the network dhcp server:
	MAC address,
	corresponding IP,
	IP of the tftp server (next-server),
	file to boot from : sparc
	no root path if tftp-hpa is started with -s option

On the tftp server
- to install debian from netboot,
  load http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-sparc/current/images/sparc64/netboot/2.6/boot.img
  and copy boot.img inside /var/tftp (I choose debian-installer/sparc64/boot.img path, your's may vary)
  write corresponding symlink:
	cd <tftproot>
	ln -sf debian-installer/sparc64/boot.img sparc

- to install ipcop-1.9.3 from netboot
	cd <tftproot>
	tar zvxf ipcop-1.9.3-install-netboot-sparc.tgz
	ln -sf ipcop/1.9.3/sparc/boot.img sparc

On the sparc machine, in openfirmware (you see ok starting the line), type
boot net:dhcp

System should now start to count file size loaded and boot
Once system is installed, it will boot from the disk.

More complete details in debian installation manual.

Count two days for a full build (including toolchain) on a Ultra5 with 256 MB 400 MHz 800 bogomips 20GB hdd
Rebuild time is 13h30 because of ccache and packaged toolchain
