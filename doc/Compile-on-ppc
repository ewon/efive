Compile IPCop on powerpc

Short installation notes for those like me (Gilles) unfamiliar with powerpc

Goal : install debian etch with powerpc netboot (work for me on a G 3 300)
First, install from cd has fail reading my cdrw, so I boot from network for a debian netinstall
( netboot work only on 'new world' machines G3 blue/white or newer )

On the ppc machine
Before or not to late after the starting sound, you could enter in openfirware
and stop booting from harddisk with:
 command + alt + O +F
( with a PC keyboard command is the windows key, the apple on original keyboard )

This is the openfirmware prompt
0 >

You could try too stop normal booting with 
 ctrl + z (z appear as a w on french keyboard)

Read ethernet local-mac-address on openfirmware and note mac value
0 > dev enet .properties
...
local-mac-address : 00050211 0d4b
...

On the tftp server
- load those files (boot.msg  initrd.gz  vmlinux  yaboot  yaboot.conf) on the tftp server
from http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/main/installer-powerpc/current/images/powerpc/netboot/
- copy files in /var/tftp/debian-installer/ppc (you path may vary, adjust for your case)

When booting, yaboot search for the mac addres at the root of the tfpt server and if not found yaboot.conf.
You could select an individual powerpc machine to use a specific yaboot.conf like this
cd /var/tftp && ln -sf debian-installer/ppc/yaboot.conf 01-00-05-02-11-0d-4b <=this is the mac address with 01- prepended
or make every powerpc machines use same yaboot.conf
cd /var/tftp && ln -sf debian-installer/ppc/yaboot.conf yaboot.conf

Ajust inside yaboot.conf the path for boot.msg, initrd and vmlinux
message=/debian-installer/ppc/boot.msg
image=/debian-installer/ppc/vmlinux
initrd=/debian-installer/ppc/initrd.gz

On the dhcp server
- wrrite a fixed lease on the network dhcp server (could be an IPCop) :
	MAC address,
	corresponding IP,
	IP of the tftp server (next-server),
	file to boot from (debian-installer/ppc/yaboot)
	no root path (not supported by yaboot to find yaboot.conf)
	root-path dhcp option look to have no effect

On the ppc machine
- in openfirmware, type
	boot enet:0
or during boot hold the 'n' letter on the keyboard to start from Network

yaboot start and should find yaboot.conf and boot.msg and other files
Once system is installed, it will boot from the disk.
